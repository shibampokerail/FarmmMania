# Inspiration
Stardew Valley and Old Pokemon games
## What it does
This is a game about a boy who helps his father out in his farm.
# controls
WASD - Move
Z - to continue conversations
1234 - for actions
Press M to play music in the HomeScreen

# Objective
Deal with crows and jumping worms in his fathers field to earn more allowance.
Use Allowance to go to market and buy more plants.
Collect as many plants as you can to win.

# How we built it
I made it using pure Javascript and p5.js library. The assets are not mine.

# Challenges we ran into
Mainly I had to build the game from the base. From usingx=x+1 for walking animations to storing the conversations in array and carrying out the battle mechanics and other stuffs using many boolean variables and some math for colliders. This has been a journey for me. 


# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I really like how it turned out. Just wish that I could work more on it. It is a bit incomplete but still I guess it is good enough.

# What we learned
That hardcoding simple game mechanics has a different charm to it. 

# What's next for Farmania
Adding more locations, more farm animals, more interactive playable story.

# Assets
- https://kijosoft.itch.io/chill-harvest-farm
- Reddit (I forgot what link I used for sprites)

- I used chatgpt instead of looking at p5.js/docs. I did not use it extensively(not that it matters, but just putting it out there!).
